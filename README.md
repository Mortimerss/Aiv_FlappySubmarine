I added sounds to the destruction of mines and crates, and the creation of bubbles.

I added an invisible wall near the end of the map, which teleports the player to the beginning and makes ObstaclePlacer start again, thus creating a loop.

I added the fuel bar above the submarine, which changes color according to the amount of fuel.

I added the game over screen with the reset button, which will restart the game.
